# bapi-cp3-expresso

Code for submission of the expresso capstone project. Code is in server.js and the server folder. 

server.js uses api.js to route calls to /api. api uses two routers, for employees and menus. employee uses an additional router for 
timesheets and menus uses an additional router for menuItems. 

All packages were installed with the -D option so npm install should install all additional packages (express, body-parser, morgan, cors).

Code passed the included tests.

Thank you!
Danielle
